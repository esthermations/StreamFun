DEVIL MAY CARE, BUT HE WON'T WIN
I AM NOT A VICTIM, BUT I'M NOT A CROOK! DON'T GIVE ME A REASON, OR A SECOND LOOK!
DON'T NEED A REASON, TO FEEL LIKE I DO---DON'T NEED A REASON, BUT I'VE STILL GOT A FEW
DON'T NEED AN END TO JUSTIFY THE MEANS
THIS IS WHERE I'LL BE, THROUGH UPS AND DOWNS AND IN-BETWEENS
YOU WERE TOUGH, BUT NOT TOUGH ENOUGH

# Dragonforce
WE FEEL THE PAIN OF A LIFETIME LOST IN A THOUSAND DAYS, THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES WE CARRY ON
